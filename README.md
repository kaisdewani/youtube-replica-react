This project was a way to practice project to see how to pass state down multiple levels and then pass it back to the main parent. In this example, when the value of videos is passed into videoList and then filtered into videoItem, I had to use () => onVideoSelect(video) in order to take the selected video back to the parent App.js file.

to start the project run npm start
